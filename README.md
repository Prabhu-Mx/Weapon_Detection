# Weapon detection 


This model is trained to detect weapons such as hand pistol, machine guns & rocket launchers in the real-time surveillance and alret the operator / to draw operator's attention.
I found the below link is really good and easy to train yolov3 model on google colab with free GPU. 

weights and cfg files can be downloaded in below link.

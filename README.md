# Weapon detection 


'Deep learningâ€™ is a great technology in the field of surveillance which makes it possible to deliver real-time and proactive security.This model is trained to detect weapons such as hand pistol, machine guns & rocket launchers in live video streaming.By letting technology do the surveillance, we could focus on taking action if something goes amiss.


# Train the model

I found the below link is really useful and easy to train yolov3 model on google colab with free GPU.Please go through this post if you want to make a any custom object detector.

As of now this model accuracy is 75%-80%.Currently I'm planning to train the model with 5000+ images,to get more accurate result.The same will be uploaded here once its done..  

weights and cfg files can be downloaded from below link.

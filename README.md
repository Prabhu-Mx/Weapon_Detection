This model is trained to detect weapons such as hand pistol, machine guns & rocket launchers in the real-time surveillance.

I found the below link is really useful and easy to train yolov3 model on google colab with free GPU.I have trained the model with 500 images and tested with 100 images.

As of now this model accuracy 70-80. Currently I am working on in train the model with 3000+ images,to get more accuracy result.The same will be updated here once its ready.
